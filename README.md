*Deprecated by Foundry version 0.7.4*

# VTT ReturnToSetup

Adds a way to return to setup from the login screen.

*Keep in mind that this means anyone can enter your setup if you don't have a password on it!*

## Installation

To install, import this [Manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ardittristan/VTTReturnToSetup/master/module.json) into your module browser.

## Usage

Log in at least once as a gm, then a new user should be generated. If you log in as that user you get sent to the setup (should probably keep the user without a password)

## Changelog

Check the [Changelog](https://github.com/ardittristan/VTTReturnToSetup/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
