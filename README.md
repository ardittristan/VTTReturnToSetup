# VTT ReturnToSetup

Adds a way to return to setup from the login screen.

## Installation

To install, import this [Manifest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ardittristan/VTTReturnToSetup/master/module.json) into your module browser.

## Usage

Log in at least once as a gm, then a new user should be generated. If you log in as that user you get sent to the setup (should probably keep the user without a password)
